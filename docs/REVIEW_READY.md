# 2026-09-09 — latest review correction

## Day-3 preparation — 2026-09-09

Six new ledger tests preserve both acquisition routes, unknown historical query mappings, zero-result versus positive query support, unscreened status despite raw flags, all raw rows and deterministic regeneration. 21 tests and repository contract pass. All 402 raw rows retained; 90 provenance holes remain. This is not full novelty closeout.

Review [DAY3_PLAN.md](DAY3_PLAN.md), [deliverable](day3-source-review.md), and [commands/evidence](../evidence/task-day3-2026-09-09/README.md). Base: `39578d6ef1ee765bcd53c7b2f0ba940b3f0d367f`; new PR branch: `task/day-three-20260909`. No original Owner/External gate is closed. Final source identity is the PR head, reported in its delivery record rather than embedded circularly here.

URC-01/D02 provenance and exact-gap closeout stay unresolved unless their full acceptance evidence exists.

Read [the D02 integrity review](../evidence/task-2026-09-09-review/README.md)
before the historical handoff below. D02 is blocked on unexplained acquisition
provenance; original literal-ID overlap is not a valid recall estimate. The
rerun/audit software passes 15 tests plus contract checks. No new literature
screening or research validation is claimed.

## Latest follow-up — 2026-09-09

[URC-D02 database export](../docs/prior-art-search-2026-09-09-database.md) adds a dated,
reproducible native-database search with a measured recall check (0/6 of the day-1 set
recovered — the two discovery routes diverge). Candidates are unscreened; no gate is closed.

## Follow-up — 2026-09-08

[URC-D01 source-review handoff](../evidence/task-2026-09-08/README.md) adds a dated
first-pass research review. It does not close the full novelty or owner gates.
Original sprint evidence below is historical; no new experimental result exists.

Prepared 2026-09-05; resumed and checked 2026-09-06. Budget: six workload days,
30 focused hours per repository; estimates are not recorded time spent.

## Completed deliverables and evidence

The checker now executes the declared JSON Schema and rejects non-finite numbers. Pilot/confirmation, SITL/HITL dependencies and the uncertain continuation band are reconciled. Marginal tube coverage is not presented as fleet safety.

Implementation: [checker](../scripts/check_repo_contract.py), [tests](../tests/test_manifest_validation.py), [roadmap](../ROADMAP.md), [research plan](research-plan.md), [first experiment](experiment-01-authority-loss.md).

7 tests passed in both the development environment and a clean consumer venv; repository contract passed; 7/7 additional metadata cases matched.

Metadata validation and research design only. No autopilot harness or conformance traces. Schema validity neither authenticates measurements nor proves a safe configuration; negative altitude remains schema-valid by design.

## Reproduce

Run from the canonical checkout using the recorded Python3.11 environment and
repository dependencies. The local pytest workaround stubs readline before import;
it is not a skipped test or changed product requirement.

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python scripts/check_repo_contract.py
python evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/evaluate_candidate.py
git diff --check
```



Delivery route: a clean temporary venv installed pinned jsonschema4.26.0 and executed absolute checker/test paths from /private/tmp. Resolved transitive versions are retained in consumer.json. The checker uses the schema-declared dialect via validator_for; [official validation API](https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/validate/) is the interface reference.

No separate configured lint/typecheck is claimed. Syntax checks are compilation,
not static typing. Saved output truncation, if present, is indicated by the tool
result metadata; no omitted output is called a full log.

## Evaluation meaning and remaining work

Selected implementation/protocol hashes and expectations were saved before the
additional cases ran. Existing tests, reviewed fixtures and reviewer-discovered
bugs are development material. All additional cases were retained. These small
developer-selected checks establish behavior on those inputs, not independent
scientific validation or general accuracy. Another agent is not a human reviewer.
External feedback: pending.

1. Owner selects resource-feasible configured vehicles and simulator versions; exact-gap novelty closeout remains pending.
2. Next implementation is one version-pinned single-vehicle authority-loss trace, then the pilot/confirmation gate—not a fleet optimizer.
3. Joint event/horizon/risk allocation and later facility approval are required for physical fleet claims.

Next action: Owner resource/configuration decision, then long-term URC-01 exact-gap closeout and the first version-pinned trace task.

Evidence-supported portfolio bullet: “Implemented nested research-manifest validation and a SITL-first protocol that separates configured recovery behavior from unproven fleet-safety claims.”
This concerns engineering quality, not adoption or measured scientific performance.

## Ready-to-send review request

“Review UAV-Recovery-Contracts against docs/SPRINT_ROADMAP.md. Repository: /Users/redhose/Developer/research-sprints/2026-09-05/UAV-Recovery-Contracts. Base commit: 55c6dd00b061da77dfb53e90c04e094ca4427d89. Final commit: PR head (see GitHub PR). Review index: docs/REVIEW_READY.md. Incomplete work: Owner selects resource-feasible configured vehicles and simulator versions; exact-gap novelty closeout remains pending. Next implementation is one version-pinned single-vehicle authority-loss trace, then the pilot/confirmation gate—not a fleet optimizer. Joint event/horizon/risk allocation and later facility approval are required for physical fleet claims. Reproduce the changed behaviors and counterexamples, rerun appropriate checks, and assess the code and evidence independently. Review first; make further changes only if requested.”
