"""Deterministic case identity: (configuration row, event class, seed) -> one frozen case.

A case ID is the unit the runner accepts, the manifest records, and the analysis counts. It is derived, not
invented: the same matrix and the same seed list always produce the same IDs, so a case cannot be quietly
added or renamed after results exist. Decisions D4 (event classes), D5 (configurations), D12 (horizon) and
the seed list live in docs/specs/formal-composition/decisions-2026-09-19.md.

#   Question    How long must the observation window be before an absence of recovery is informative?
#   Inputs      COM_DL_LOSS_T = 10 s   sourced, vendor default [B10, Q-DL-LOSS-T]
#               COM_FAIL_ACT_T = 5 s   sourced, vendor default [B10, Q-FAIL-ACT-T]
#               predicted transition at +15 s after injection (timeline T1, calculated from the two above)
#   Assumption  the response is a mode change, not a completed manoeuvre. Completion is out of scope (D17), so
#               no climb, travel or descent time enters this number.
#   Model       horizon >= detection + hold delay + margin for the mode change to be logged and observed
#   Substitute  10 s + 5 s + margin;  45 s leaves 30 s beyond the predicted transition
#   Result      45 s, selected, not forced. Any value above about 20 s satisfies the model.
#   Sensitivity Too short reports a false ABSENCE of recovery, which is the exact conclusion these runs reach,
#               so the margin is deliberately large rather than tight.
#   Validation  Partial. The 2026-09-23 run held its mode for the whole horizon, so the horizon was not the
#               limiting factor in that absence. A recovery slower than 45 s has not been excluded by measurement.
