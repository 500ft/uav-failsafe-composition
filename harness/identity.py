"""Three identities, kept apart, because they answer three different questions (owner review 2026-09-25, WP1).

    scenario_id    what was ASKED FOR. Computable before launch, from the case alone.
    execution_id   what a particular attempt ACTUALLY DID. Needs the vehicle, so it exists only after a run.
    analysis_id    how a set of raw bytes was INTERPRETED. Changes when the normaliser or the contract changes,
                   while the execution and the raw bytes it describes stay exactly as they were.

The earlier `parameters_sha256` tried to be the first and the second at once, which cannot work: a case cannot
be selected by the hash of a readback that does not exist until the vehicle is up. Splitting them also fixes a
quieter problem. The runner reads back only the parameters it explicitly set, so that hash covers the overrides
and not the vehicle's configuration; it is named `overrides_readback_sha256` here and nothing calls it complete.
