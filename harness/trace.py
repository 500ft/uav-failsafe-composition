"""Normalise a run directory (raw.jsonl + flight.ulg) into the URC-03 trace format and validate it against the schema.

Every instant carries where its number came from (`t_source`), because this run has two clocks:

    vehicle_observation  the vehicle's own clock, read at that instant (injector events, time_boot_ms)
    autopilot_log        a native uLog timestamp, already on the vehicle clock
    host_reconstructed   host time minus the median offset, which is an estimate and not a measurement

An instant that is not the vehicle's own stamp carries `t_vehicle_interval_s`, a bound with an OPEN UPPER SIDE.

Only the lower side is defensible. A packet stamped at vehicle time v and received at host time h proves the
vehicle clock had reached v by h, and both clocks advance, so every later host instant is at or after v. The
upper side does not follow: a packet stamped at v may sit in transit and arrive after the instant in question,
so the next received stamp can be EARLIER than the vehicle's true time at that instant. Concretely, a sample
generated at 8 arriving at host 10, a local action at host 11, and a sample generated at 9 arriving at host 12
are all monotone, yet [8, 9] does not contain the action (owner review 2026-09-25, R1). PR #29 published that
bracket as if it were a containment interval. Closing the upper side needs a justified transport or timebase
bound, or a causally post-event acknowledgment with stated timestamp semantics. This rig has neither, so the
upper side stays null and every timing comparison that depends on it is inconclusive, never a pass.

    vehicle_observation         the vehicle stamped this message; the reading itself is exact
    autopilot_log               a native uLog timestamp, stamped by the autopilot at the event
    cached_vehicle_observation  the newest telemetry stamp the runner held when it acted; a lower bound on the
                                vehicle clock at that moment, not the moment's timestamp, with `cache_age_host_s`
    host_reconstructed          host time minus the median offset, an estimate with no exact reading behind it

The offset spread is a dispersion of the offset estimates, not a calibrated uncertainty (critique 2026-09-24, F1).
